# Work Showcase
This is a small Github repository that was created with the intent to showcase some code that I have written since I am a computer science student who hasn't yet contributed to any major projects.

Many of these code samples are Project Euler problems. Project Euler is a website found at https://projecteuler.net that contains computational problems that must be solved with clever coding. In each folder I have written a description of the problem that must be solved along with a description of my method I used to solve the problem and relevant computer output. Each Project Euler problem has a number which corresponds to the archive number of the problems found at https://projecteuler.net/archives.
